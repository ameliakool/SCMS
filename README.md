"# SCMS" 

This code was developed in: Eclipse IDE for Java Developers - 2024-12

Project by Amelia Kool 25774077 - Alternative Assessment Individual Project for SSP Student

The project folder name is 'SmartCampus'
All .java files are to be contained within the package 'smart' under the src.

Add the attached .png files into a resource folder on the same level as the src with their original names: icon1.png, ClassroomSchedule.png, RecordManage.png and ResourceManage.png.

There will be three data containing files .dat, they are initialised in SmartCampusSystem and contain any data added, removed or edited. To restore this data to the original, simply go to the file location of the three .dat files and delete them. The system will reconfigure them upon a new startup, and when realising they are gone will build new ones.
